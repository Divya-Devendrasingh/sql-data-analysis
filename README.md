## 📌 SQL Basics

This section covers foundational SQL concepts:

- Filtering using `WHERE`  
- Pattern matching using `LIKE`  
- Sorting using `ORDER BY`  
- Conditional operators (`AND`, `OR`, `BETWEEN`)  

**Dataset used:**  
`employees (id, name, department, salary, joining_date)`

---

## 📌 SQL Intermediate

## 🔗 Joins

This section focuses on combining data from multiple tables.

### Topics Covered:
- INNER JOIN  
- LEFT JOIN  
- RIGHT JOIN  
- Finding missing data using `JOIN + NULL`  
- Aggregations with joins (`SUM`, `COUNT`)  

### Example Tables:
- Customers (customer_id, name, city)  
- Orders (order_id, customer_id, amount)  

### Key Learnings:
- INNER JOIN → matching records  
- LEFT JOIN → keeps all left table data  
- NULL filtering → identify missing relationships  
- Aggregations → derive business insights

## 🔗Aggregation

This folder contains SQL queries using GROUP BY and HAVING for data analysis.

## Topics Covered:
- GROUP BY basics
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- HAVING clause for filtering groups
- Aggregations with JOIN
- Identifying missing data using LEFT JOIN

## Key Learnings:
- GROUP BY groups rows for aggregation
- HAVING filters aggregated results
- LEFT JOIN helps include missing data
- Aggregations are used for business insights

## Use Cases:
- Customer order analysis
- Revenue calculation
- Performance tracking

## 🔗 CASE WHEN

This folder contains SQL queries using CASE WHEN to apply conditional logic within queries.

## Topics Covered:
- Conditional logic using CASE WHEN
- Multiple condition handling
- CASE WHEN with aggregations
- Creating derived columns

## Key Learnings:
- CASE WHEN works like IF-ELSE logic in SQL
- Conditions are evaluated in order
- Can be used with aggregation functions
- Helps transform raw data into meaningful categories

## Use Cases:
- Customer segmentation  
- Categorizing data (High / Medium / Low)  
- Creating flags (Above Avg / Below Avg)  
- Business rule implementation

## 🔗 Subqueries

This folder contains SQL queries using subqueries to perform nested queries for filtering and calculations.

## Topics Covered:
- Scalar subqueries (single value)
- IN and EXISTS subqueries
- Subqueries with aggregation
- Nested queries for filtering

## Key Learnings:
- Subqueries allow multi-step query logic
- Can be used in SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING
- Must return compatible data for comparison
- Useful for comparing values like averages or totals

## Use Cases:
- Filtering based on averages  
- Comparing values across groups  
- Identifying high-performing customers  
- Breaking complex problems into smaller queries

## 🔗 Window Functions

This folder contains SQL queries using window functions to perform calculations across rows without collapsing the dataset.

## Topics Covered:
- ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
- PARTITION BY for grouping within window functions
- ORDER BY within window functions
- Ranking and ordering data
- Running totals and cumulative calculations

## Key Learnings:
- Window functions do not reduce the number of rows
- PARTITION BY divides data into logical groups
- ORDER BY defines calculation sequence
- Useful for ranking and analytical queries

## Use Cases:
- Top N records per group  
- Latest record per customer  
- Ranking customers/orders  
- Running totals and trend analysis
